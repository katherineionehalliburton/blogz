fix validation - not running - a return is not correct


User visits the /blog page and sees a list of all blog entries by all users (this was working in the getitdone project - when a blog was added it would mix together with the other users blogs - find out how to get the code back to that)


make handler for index page (done?)


make dynamic user list (issues, two possible options - one in /index and one in /may need this...)


require login for blogs and index pages, works for login and register pages
